## Description:
This repository houses a collection of weather application projects that leverage a stack of web technologies to provide real-time weather information. These projects serve as a practical demonstration of using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js to create dynamic and user-friendly weather applications. The core functionality is achieved by integrating the OpenWeatherMap global services API.

## Key Features:

**HTML and CSS:** 
> The user interface (UI) of these weather apps is crafted with HTML and styled with CSS to provide an intuitive and visually appealing experience.

**JavaScript:** 
> JavaScript powers the interactivity of these applications. It handles user inputs, makes API requests to OpenWeatherMap, and dynamically updates the weather information displayed to the user.

**Node.js:** 
> Node.js is used for server-side development in certain projects. It enables server-based operations and provides a back-end for handling API requests and data processing.

**OpenWeatherMap API:** 
> These projects utilize the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch up-to-date weather data from around the country. This data includes temperature, humidity, temperature status, and more.

## Projects Included:

**Simple Weather App:** 
> A basic weather app that displays the current weather conditions.

**Weather Dashboard:** 
> A more comprehensive weather dashboard that allows users to search for weather information for multiple locations. It displays detailed weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind, and a weather icon.

**Node.js Weather Server:** 
> A Node.js-based server that serves weather data through API endpoints. It provides a foundation for building more advanced weather applications
